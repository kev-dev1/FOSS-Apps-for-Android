# FOSS Apps for Android

This is a little Script that's I create for install FOSS Apps for all Android Devices.

# For what i create this Script?
I love Android and Open Source Software, but we use proprietary Apps that´s tracing us and sell us data,
that´s why I use and love personaly Open Source Software. It´s Open Source and a better Alternative to the other non-free Apps.

# It´s contain FOSS Apps:
- F-Droid
- OSMAnd
- Davx5
- OpenTasks
- NewPipe
- FlorisBoard

# Install this on Linux before use:
- aria2c
- android-sdk

# For Windows 
It´s exist in the "files" Folder.

# In the future
I will add more FOSS Applications in the List.
You can contribute this Project too. Make a Request on Github and write what for FOSS Applications is better alternative to Google Apps and can in the List.
