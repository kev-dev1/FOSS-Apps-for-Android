FOSS Apps for Android

This is a little Script that's I create for a helpfully install on all My Android Devices.

What's get to use this Script is:
- Wget
- Android-SDK (ADB)

This Script contain these FOSS Apps:
- F-Droid
- OSMAnd
- Davx5
- OpenTasks
- NewPipe

In the future, I will add more FOSS Applications in the List and make this for Windows User too.
